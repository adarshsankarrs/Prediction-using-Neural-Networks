# Prediction-using-Neural-Networks
Fruit Prediction using Pretrained CNN Model

We use a pre-trained CNN models to classify fruits as per associated classes

We make use of VGG16

We set our model for training and iterate through batches to generate predictions and calculate the loss associated with them as well.

The ipynb file has the code in Python, with outputs.
